FAQ:
----
- *"What benefits does* `msyt` *have over MSBT Editor Reloaded, Kuriimu, or* `.xmsbt`?"

  1. Instead of being a full fledged editor, `msyt` is simply a tool for converting BotW `msbt` files to and from a `yaml` format. This allows for easy and efficient editing using whatever method is most comfortable to the user.

   2. Additionally, `msyt` also converts (known) BotW dialogue control codes into an easy to modify `yaml` representation.

      **TL;DR:** No more hex editing.

- *"What does* `msyt` *mean?"*
  -  `msbt` is assumed to be an acronym for `Message Standard Binary Table`, so in the same respect, `msyt` stands for `Message Standard Yaml Table`.

 - *"Awh, geez.. EVERY time I open* `notepad++`*, my \*FAVORITE\* editor, I have to manually set the language to* `yaml`*. I want pretty colors by default!"*
 
   - Don't fear, there's a simple solution!
     1. In `notepad++`, select `Settings -> Style Configurator...`
     2. In the `Language` box, find and select `YAML` from the list.
     3. Under `User ext.`, type `msyt`
